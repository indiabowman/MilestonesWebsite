<p>ENIAC was developed by John Presper Eckert and John W.Mauchly, ENIAC stands
   for the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer and it was built at the
   University Of Pennsylvania in 1946. The University described it as the first
   general-purpose electronic computer, its "operational characteristics" included memory and
    arithmetic. It often broke because of the use of vacuum tubes, and someone had to find
     the broken tube which was usually not an easy job and replace it with a working tube.
     The ENIAC was first designed to print firing tables for U.S Navy artillery, however
      the war ended before the machine was completed. Making programs for the computer was
      a difficult task. Making the computer ready for one single program could take many days
       or weeks. The programming had to be done by pulling wires from one place to another
        was easy for small programs, but a challenge for larger programs. ENIAC was shut down
        on October 2, 1955 with about 10 panels existing.</p>

  <p>IBM launched its personal computer in August 1981. The company was first named
    "Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company" until they changed the name to "International
     Business Machines" in 1924 after Thomas J. Watson became president of the company
      in 1914. The company's first experiments with computers in the 1940s and 1950s were
       modest advances on the card-based system. The company's great breakthrough came in
       the 1960s with its System/360 family of mainframe computers. Its PC wasn't the first
       since others had been available since the 1970s the PC's version became incredibly
       popular and set standards. The cost was $1,565 and had 40K of read-only-memory and
       16K of user memory. It included a build in speaker and could run self-diagnostic
       checks. It also used Microsoft's MS-DOS 1.0 which is a 16-bit operating system.
       In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company found difficulty with losses exceeding
       to $8 billion in 1993 with the mainframe failing to adjust quick enough to the
       "personal computer revolution". After a series of reorganizations, IBM remains one of
       the world's largest computer companies and systems integrators.</p>

      <p>Steve Jobs launched the first Macintosh in January 1984. He showcased a
        number of the Macintosh's capabilities like talking to <br>a drawing application
        to produce images. He stated that the Macintosh was targeted at two primary
        markets, the "knowledge workers"<br>who sit behind desks in businesses and the college workers.

<p>Microsoft launched Windows 1.0 to market in November 1985 to be used as an
  operating system with a graphical interface. Now millions of people worlwide use
  the latest versions of Windows.</p>
