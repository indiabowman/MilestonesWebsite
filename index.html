<p>ENIAC was developed by John Presper Eckert and John W.Mauchly, ENIAC stands
   for the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer and it was built at the
   University Of Pennsylvania in 1946. The University described it as the first
   general-purpose electronic computer, its "operational characteristics" included memory and
    arithmetic. It often broke because of the use of vacuum tubes, and someone had to find
     the broken tube which was usually not an easy job and replace it with a working tube.
     The ENIAC was first designed to print firing tables for U.S Navy artillery, however
      the war ended before the machine was completed. Making programs for the computer was
      a difficult task. Making the computer ready for one single program could take many days
       or weeks. The programming had to be done by pulling wires from one place to another
        was easy for small programs, but a challenge for larger programs. ENIAC was shut down
        on October 2, 1955 with about 10 panels existing.</p>

  <p>IBM launched its personal computer in August 1981. The company was first named
    "Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company" until they changed the name to "International
     Business Machines" in 1924 after Thomas J. Watson became president of the company
      in 1914. The company's first experiments with computers in the 1940s and 1950s were
       modest advances on the card-based system. The company's great breakthrough came in
       the 1960s with its System/360 family of mainframe computers. Its PC wasn't the first
       since others had been available since the 1970s the PC's version became incredibly
       popular and set standards. The cost was $1,565 and had 40K of read-only-memory and
       16K of user memory. It included a build in speaker and could run self-diagnostic
       checks. It also used Microsoft's MS-DOS 1.0 which is a 16-bit operating system.
       In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company found difficulty with losses exceeding
       to $8 billion in 1993 with the mainframe failing to adjust quick enough to the
       "personal computer revolution". After a series of reorganizations, IBM remains one of
       the world's largest computer companies and systems integrators.</p>

      <p>Steve Jobs launched the first Macintosh in January 1984. The computer was
        the first commercially successful personal computer to feature two old, but
        still unpopular features: the mouse and the graphical user interface. He
        showcased a number of the Macintosh's capabilities like talking to a drawing
         application to produce images. He stated that the Macintosh was targeted at
         two primary markets, the "knowledge workers" who sit behind desks in businesses
          and the college workers. The project to create the Macintosh started in the
          late 1970s with Jef Raskin who wanted to name the computer after his favorite
          apple, the McIntosh, but later had to change the name due to legal reasons.
          He assembled a large development team that designed and built the original
          hardware and software for the Macintosh. The design caught the attention of
          Steve Jobs who was the co-founder of Apple. The Macintosh 128 was announced
          to the press in October 1983 and was introduced in January 1984. </p>

<p>Microsoft is a multinational technology corporation that was founded on April
  4th, 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership
   with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers. In 1985 IBM
   requested Microsoft to develop a new operating system for their computers called
   OS/2. Microsoft produced the operating system and also continued to sell their
   alternate which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft launched
   Windows 1.0 to market in November 1985 to be used as an operating system with a
    graphical interface. Now millions of people worldwide use the latest versions of
    Windows. The program eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales, and when
    Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s they captured
    over 90% market share of the world's personal computers. Microsoft now has a global
    annual revenue of about $86.83 Billion USD and 128,076 employees worldwide.</p>

      <p>The 21st century has seen the mass adoption of broadband internet across
         the developed world. Today's homes are rapidly transforming into spaces
         where traditional computers are with newer pieces of technology like smartphones,
          smart TV's, virtual assistants, and tablets. With the simple click of a button,
           a song that's being played on a computer in someone's room could be displayed
           onto a TV in their living room with a high speed connection. The merging of
           physical and virtual worlds is known as the internet now. People are now
           accustomed to high-speed downloads, quick browsing, high-resolution streaming
           and more. According to the communications regulator of Ofcom, there were
           25.3 million fixed broadband connections at the end of 2016 in the U.K. </p>
